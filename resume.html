        <ul>
            <li>Collaborated to engineer infrastructure to read and parse streams of data from Kafka into Kudu using Spark.</li>
            <li>Integrated Jupyter notebooks with Impala to provide simple access to rapidly changing distributed data to researchers in Zurich, London, and Oxford.</li>
        </ul>

        <b>Data Science Fellow, Insight Data Science, Palo Alto, California&emsp;(2016)</b><br/>
        <ul>
            <li>Consulted for startup DeepGram to automatically segment unidentified speakers in recorded audio files. </li>
            <li>Engineered unsupervised algorithm combining spectral decomposition, PCA, and hierarchical clustering (matarhaller.com)</li>
            <li>Built novel validation dataset with known ground truth by scraping and splicing audiobooks (72% accuracy).</li>
            <li>Delivered code for use in existing predictive models and company proof of concept pitches.</li>
            <li>Accepted as talk to Strata-Hadoop 2017 in San Jose, CA.</li>
