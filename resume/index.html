    <p class="lead"><h3>Tools</h3></p>
    <p>Proficient: Python, MATLAB, SQL, git</br>
                Familiar: Scala, Apache Hadoop ecosystem (Kafka, Spark, Kudu, Impala), R, Lisp, Tableau, bash, HTML

    <p class="lead"><h3>Experience</h3></p>
        <p><b>Data Scientist, Winton Capital</b>, San Francisco, California (2016 - present)<br/>
        <ul>
            <li>Collaborated to engineer infrastructure to read and parse streams of data from Kafka into Kudu using Spark.</li>
        <li>Integrated Jupyter notebooks with Impala to provide simple access to rapidly changing distributed data to researchers in Zurich, London, and Oxford.</li>
        </ul>
        <br/>

        <b>Data Science Fellow, Insight Data Science</b>, Palo Alto, California (2016)<br/>
        <ul>
            <li>Consulted for startup DeepGram to automatically segment unidentified speakers in recorded audio files. </li>
            <li>Engineered unsupervised algorithm combining spectral decomposition, PCA, and hierarchical clustering (matarhaller.com)</li>
            <li>Built novel validation dataset with known ground truth by scraping and splicing audiobooks (72% accuracy).</li>
            <li>Delivered code for use in existing predictive models and company proof of concept pitches.</li>
            <li>Accepted as talk to Strata-Hadoop 2017 in San Jose, CA.</li>

        <br/>

        <b>Graduate Student Researcher, Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute</b>, University of California, Berkeley (2010-2016)<br/>
        <ul>
        <li>Recorded activity from surgically implanted electrodes on human brains. Implemented time series analyses, PCA, clustering, ridge regression and permutation tests to link neuronal activity with behavior.</li>
        <li>Developed method for extracting oscillatory components from power spectra using linear regression, k-means clustering, curve fitting and cross validation. Precision and recall match human performance.</li>
        <li>Supervised and mentored research assistants and graduate students. Taught experimental design, electrophysiology recording, and analysis pipeline using Python and MATLAB.</li>
