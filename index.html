    <p class="lead">
    I am a data scientist at <a href="http://www.sparkbeyond.com/">SparkBeyond</a> where we are building an automated research engine that is accelerating discoveries across a variety of domains. Prior to SparkBeyond, I was a data scientist at <a href="http://www.winton.com">Winton Capital</a>, where I explored signals in diverse datasets. I was also a fellow at <a href="http://www.insightdatascience.com"> Insight Data Science</a> where I collaborated with <a href="https://www.deepgram.com/">DeepGram</a> to <a href="https://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/strata-ca-2017/public/schedule/speaker/257592">engineer an algorithm</a> for automatic speech segmentation from audio streams.</p>

    <p class="lead">I did my PhD in <a href="http://knightlab.berkeley.edu/">Dr. Robert Knight's laboratory</a>
    at the <a href="http://neuroscience.berkeley.edu">Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute</a>
    at the <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu">University of California at Berkeley</a>, where I studied
    the link between perception and action by recording activity from electrodes surgically placed on the
    surface of human brains.

    <p class="lead">Before my PhD, I was a preschool teacher and a tank instructor (not at the same time!).
    I am passionate about expanding opportunities for women in STEM fields, and
    am a mother to a wonderful toddler who surprises me every day.</p>
