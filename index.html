<p>I currently am a data scientist at <a href="http://www.winton.com">Winton Capital</a>
in San Francisco. Prior to working at Winton, I was a data science fellow at
<a href="http://www.insightdatascience.com">Insight Data Science</a>
where I engineered an algorithm for automatic speaker segmentation from audio streams.</p>
<p>I did my PhD in <a href="http://knightlab.berkeley.edu/">Dr. Robert Knight's laboratory</a>
at the <a href="http://neuroscience.berkeley.edu">Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute</a>
at the <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu">University of California at Berkeley</a>, where I studied
the link between perception and action by recording activity from electrodes placed directly on the
 surface of the human brain.
<p>Before my PhD, I was a preschool teacher and a tank instructor in the military (not at the same time!).
